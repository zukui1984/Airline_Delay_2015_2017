# Flight Delays and Cancellations Analysis (2015-2017)
This dataset comprises information on flight delays and cancellations spanning from *January 2015 to December 2017*. The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickzel/flight-delay-and-cancellation-dataset-2019-2023) from Kaggle was sourced from the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) On-Time Reporting Carrier On-Time Performance, a comprehensive database tracking the punctuality of domestic flights by major carriers since 1987 (www.transtats.bts.gov)

## Data Overview
The dataset encompasses various variables including flight routes (origin and destination), event timestamps (in minutes, local time), and reasons/attributions for delays and cancellations, albeit with some limitations.

## Questions for Analysis
1. What are the most common reasons for flight delays and cancellations?
2. Which flight routes experience the most delays and cancellations?
3. How do delays and cancellations vary by time (e.g., time of day, day of the week, month, season, year)?
4. Are there any patterns or trends in flight delays and cancellations over time?
5. How do different air carriers compare in terms of delays and cancellations?

## Possible Findings from the Analysis
1. Trends: When flights are usually late or cancelled
2. Patterns: Which flight routes often have problems
3. Comparisons: Compare airlines to see who is often late or on time
4. Reasons: Can explain why flights get delayed or cancelled
