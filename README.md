# US Domestic Flight Cancellations focus. Los Angeles Airport (LAX) Analysis (2015-2017)
This dataset comprises information on flight delays and cancellations spanning from *January 2015 to December 2017*. The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gabrielluizone/us-domestic-flights-delay-prediction-2013-2018) from Kaggle was sourced from the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) On-Time Reporting Carrier On-Time Performance, a comprehensive database tracking the punctuality of domestic flights by major carriers since 1987 (www.transtats.bts.gov)

## Data Overview
The dataset encompasses various variables including flight routes (origin and destination), event timestamps (in minutes, local time), and reasons/attributions for delays and cancellations, albeit with some limitations.

## Questions for Analysis
1. What are the most common reasons for flight delays and cancellations?
2. Which flight routes experience the most delays and cancellations?
3. How do delays and cancellations vary by time (e.g., time of day, day of the week, month, season, year)?
4. Are there any patterns or trends in flight delays and cancellations over time?
5. How do different air carriers compare in terms of delays and cancellations?

## Facts Findings from the Analysis
1.	Delay is happening mostly July & August
2.	Afternoon time (Arrival) + Morning (Departure)
3.	Friday + Thursday are mostly happen
4.	Late Aircraft / Carrer / Security: June, July + August


## Improvement Suggestions
1.	Hiring more staff especially during those peak months to minimize time as much as possible.
2.	Training current staff is also another suggestion for better. Eg security check can be quicker.
3.	Should improve weather forecast predictions by using new software – just in case they aren’t still updating their systems.
4.	Improve the infrastructure surrounding LAX airport by upgrading some facilities or maybe get more taxi services just in case a long delay happens.
5.	During delay waiting, they can provide them a service as an apology
