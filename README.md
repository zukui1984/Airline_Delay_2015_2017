# US Domestic Flight Cancellations Analysis (2015-2017)
This dataset comprises information on flight delays and cancellations spanning from *January 2015 to December 2017*. The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gabrielluizone/us-domestic-flights-delay-prediction-2013-2018) from Kaggle was sourced from the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) On-Time Reporting Carrier On-Time Performance, a comprehensive database tracking the punctuality of domestic flights by major carriers since 1987 (www.transtats.bts.gov)

## Questions
1. During which months did flight delays peak?
2. What were the top 3 airports with the highest average departure delay minutes?
3. What were the main factors contributing to flight delays during this period?
4. Which factor accounted for the largest percentage of delays?
5. Which airline had the highest cancellation rate?
6. How did the on-time arrival and departure percentages compare?

## Analysis Process



## Suggestions
1. Address carrier issues that contribute significantly to delays, such as aircraft maintenance, crew scheduling, and ground operations.
2. Improve coordination and efficiency within the National Aviation System to reduce air traffic control delays.
3. Implement strategies to better manage aircraft turnaround times and minimize cascading delays from late arrivals.
4. Enhance airport infrastructure and operations at major hubs like ATL, ORD, and LAX to improve on-time performance.
5. Provide additional resources and support to regional carriers to reduce their higher cancellation rates.
6. Increase staffing and implement contingency plans during peak summer travel periods to mitigate delays.
